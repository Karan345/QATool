The continuous miniaturisation of metal–oxide–
semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) from long- to
short-channel architectures has advanced beyond the predictions
of Moore’s Law. Continued advances in semiconductor
electronics, even near current scaling and performance
boundaries under cryogenic conditions, are driving the
development of innovative device paradigms that enable ultra–
low-power and high-speed functionality. Among emerging
candidates, the Josephson Junction Field-Effect Transistor
(JJFET or JoFET) provides an alternative by integrating
superconducting source and drain electrodes for efficient, phase-
coherent operation at ultra-low temperatures. These hybrid
devices have the potential to bridge conventional semiconductor
electronics with cryogenic logic and quantum circuits, enabling
energy-efficient and high-coherence signal processing across
temperature domains. This review traces the evolution from
Josephson junctions to field-effect transistors, emphasising the
structural and functional innovations that underpin modern
device scalability. The performance and material compatibility of
JJFETs fabricated on Si, GaAs, and InGaAs substrates are
analysed, alongside an assessment of their switching dynamics and
material compatibility. Particular attention is given to
superconductor–silicon–superconductor Josephson junctions as
the active core of JJFET architectures. By unfolding more than
four decades of experimental progress, this work highlights the
promise of JJFETs as foundational building blocks for next-
generation cryogenic logic and quantum electronic systems.
